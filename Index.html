    <h1>Abdullahi Abdi</h1>
    
    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <p>I'm a Healthcare Operations Coordinator at Riverside Home Health and a Computer Science and Economics student at the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities. I'm passionate about using technology to bridge real-world issues and aspire to build products that make a meaningful impact on people's lives.</p>
    
    <p>My journey has taken me from analyzing digital visibility for hundreds of local restaurants to coordinating frontline technology support, and now to healthcare operations. Along the way, I've discovered that the most interesting problems sit at the intersection of technology, economics, and human needs.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a <strong>MLT Career Prep Fellow</strong> and serve as <strong>Academic & Professional Co-Chair</strong> for ColorStack UMN, where I lead programming to support underrepresented students in computing. I also contribute to civic initiatives as a member of <strong>Youth on Board</strong> for the City of Saint Paul, bringing data-informed perspectives to budgeting and grant decisions.</p>
    
    <h2>What I Do:</h2>
    
    <p>Currently, I work as a Healthcare Operations Coordinator at Riverside Home Health, where I help streamline operations and improve care delivery. Previously, I spent time with the Ramsey County Tech Squad providing frontline technology support and at NCXT.co analyzing digital visibility for local restaurants as part of the Saint Paul Resiliency Project.</p>
    
    <p>What ties these experiences together is a focus on understanding how people work, identifying friction points, and finding ways technology can help. Whether it's helping a restaurant owner understand their online presence or coordinating healthcare operations, I'm drawn to problems where technology meets human needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Things I've Built:</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Restaurant Digital Presence Analysis</strong><br>
    <small>2023</small><br>
    Analyzed the online visibility of 386 local restaurants in Saint Paul, uncovering that most small businesses had critical gaps in their digital presence. Built dashboards that helped city leaders allocate $2M in support funds to the restaurants that needed it most. The project taught me how data analysis can inform real community impact.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Investment Research Tool</strong><br>
    <small>2025</small><br>
    Built a system that lets users ask questions about SEC filings in natural language instead of manually reading through hundreds of pages. The goal was to make financial research more accessible and save people time when making investment decisions.</p>
    
    <h2>Beyond Work:</h2>
    
    <p>I'm fortunate to be part of communities that push me to grow. As Academic & Professional Co-Chair for ColorStack UMN, I help create opportunities for students who might not otherwise see themselves in tech. Through Youth on Board with the City of Saint Paul, I contribute to decisions about how public resources get allocated in our community.</p>
    
    <p>I believe technology should serve people, not the other way around. The best products come from deeply understanding problems and the people who experience them. That's what draws me to product management and why I'm excited about building things that matter.</p>
